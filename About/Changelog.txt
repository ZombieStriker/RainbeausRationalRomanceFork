- 12/05/2018
	- Made some more minor tweaks to the date functionality.
	- Rewrote XML patches to improve load efficiency slightly.

- 11/15/2018
	- Fixed a bug that sometimes allowed pawns with preexisting romantic partners
	  to be assigned two different orientation traits.
	  
- 11/11/2018
	- Added options sliders to adjust the rate at which pawns propose dates and
	  hookups.
	- Made a few very minor tweaks which might (or might not) resolve lingering
	  problems (if any) with date functionality.

- 11/06/2018
	- Pawns now check to see if their intended targets are actually available
	  before walking across the map to ask for a date or to propose a hookup. So
	  you should no longer have to deal, for example, with pacifist Joel walking
	  into the middle of a firefight because he wants to know if his girlfriend
	  Sally is interested in leaving the combat to go on a romantic walk.

- 11/04/2018
	- Added support for polyamorous relationships. The code is based in part on
	  polyamory code from the original "Romance Diversified," and also in part on
	  code from Linq/Word-Mule's "Psychology" mod.
	- Culture now plays a role in determining a pawn's likelihood to initiate a
	  romantic encounter or to propose marriage.
	- The impact of the Ugly trait on romantic attraction is lessened for pawns
	  who have that trait themselves.
    - Replaced the date walk code with a clean copy of the vanilla walk code,
	  just in case some subtle difference was responsible for the problems some
	  users have seen with pawns not actually going on dates.
	- Added a few log messages that will hopefully help me track down the reason
	  for the problems if the above change doesn't actually fix them.
	  
- 10/26/2018
	- When on a date, both pawns (and not just the following pawn) will now gain
	  joy, as obviously should have been happening all along.
	- Squashed a bug that completely prevented cross-species romances.
	- Added a configuration option to affect the likelihood of pawns actually
	  being interested in cross-species romance. (Obviously, this setting is 
	  meaningless if you're not playing with any alien races.)
	- Pawns of non-gendered alien races will no longer be given an orientation
	  trait.
